mobile data on/off test with UI Automator

"svc data enable/disable" turned out to not work (currently) on Pixel2 API 29 virtual device from Firebase Test Lab (while still fine in the same configuration on AVD locally).

That's a try-out of an UI Automator for the sake of education, as well as making sure the disabling/enabling itself is not broken in general, but only in the way it's done through adb.
